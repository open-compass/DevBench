- Uniformity and Integration: The design should demonstrate a consistent style and integrated approach, ensuring all components work seamlessly together.
- Cohesion and Decoupling: Evaluate the sequence diagram for its cohesion within sequences and coupling between different parts of the system. The goal is to ensure each sequence is focused, with minimal dependencies between different system components. Strive for high cohesion within sequences and low coupling between them.
- Interaction complexity: This metric assesses the interaction complexity of the sequence diagram, focusing on the number of messages, depth of nested calls, and the number of participating objects. It also examines how the sequence of messages and the roles of key objects are portrayed in these interactions. The ideal level of complexity should be in line with the specific requirements detailed in the project's PRD
- Practicability: This comprehensive metric includes aspects of readability, understandability, class and method representation, and the overall clarity in depicting system interactions and functionalities. Evaluate the diagram's ease of interpretation for development, testing, and maintenance, its ability to represent the functionality and purpose of each class, document object creation instances, and demonstrate the modularity and interface simplicity that support efficient and reliable system operation.
