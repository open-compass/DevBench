- Ensure that the design aligns with the given PRD strictly, achieving all the functionalities based on the requirements without making any hallucinations and additions. Ensure that the conceptual classes and their relationships accurately represent the essentials outlined in the PRD. This includes a detailed focus on the associations between classes, their cardinalities, and the types of relationships such as inheritance, aggregation, and composition. Clarity in class names and the optional inclusion of attributes are key for aligning with the project's vision.
