- Cohesion and Decoupling: The design should aim for high cohesion within individual classes and low coupling between different classes. High cohesion ensures that each class is dedicated to a singular task or concept, enhancing clarity and functionality. Low coupling reduces dependencies among classes, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
- Complexity: Utilize metrics such as the total number of classes, the average number of methods per class, and the depth of the inheritance tree to evaluate complexity. It's important to discern between conceptual classes and attributes; not every noun should become a class. The complexity level should be appropriately balanced, aligning with the specific requirements detailed in the project's Product Requirement Document (PRD).
- Practicability: A practical design should be readable and understandable, offering a clear and comprehensive representation of the software's structures, functionalities, and behaviors. This enhances ease in programming, testing, and maintenance. Modularity should be evident, with each component serving a distinct function, streamlining the development process. Interfaces need to be designed for simplicity, facilitating smooth interactions within the software and with external environments. The design must also support robust testing strategies, enabling thorough validation through unit and acceptance tests, ensuring the design's viability in real-world applications.
