- Uniformity and Integration: The design should demonstrate a consistent style and integrated approach, ensuring all components work seamlessly together, ensuring high cohesion and decoupling.
- Distinction Between Design and Coding: Recognize that the design process is distinct from coding; good design lays the groundwork for effective coding but is not synonymous with it.
- Practicability: Evaluate the architecture's practicability by assessing its organization, readability and modularity, and efficiency. The design should feature a logical and clear structure, evidenced by a well-organized file tree and distinct class locations in proper directories.
- Conformance: Evaluate the architecture for its conformance to community and industry standards. The file tree structure, coding practices including naming conventions, documentation and other structural elements should adhere to the widely accepted conventions by the open-source community and best practices of the programming language used, such as C++, Python, Java and JavaScript.
