PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

./UMM command target [options..]

## Add records

To add a new student, faculty or school, use the following command:
```
./UMM add person | school [options..]
```

Compulsory options for person:

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Compulsory options for school:

-name: string

## List records

To list all students, faculty or schools, use the following command:
```
./UMM search person | school 
```

Available options for person (at least one option to list records):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Delete records

./UMM delete person | school -id ID

## Update records

./UMM update person | school -id ID [options..]

-id is compulsory to update a person or school record.

Available options for person (at least one option to update a record):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Mentor

To assign a mentor for a student:

./UMM mentor assign -student STUDENT_ID -mentor FACULTY_ID

To look for the mentor of a given student:

./UMM mentor lookup -student STUDENT_ID

To look for students a given mentor mentors:

./UMM mentor lookup -mentor FACULTY_ID

# Acceptance Criteria
Each feature should meet the following criteria:
- **Correctness**: The system should execute commands accurately, reflecting the correct changes in the database.
- **Efficiency**: The system should handle database operations swiftly without delays.
- **Usability**: Users should find the system easy to use, with a straightforward command structure.

# Dependencies
- **C++ Environment**: Necessary for running the main.cpp file.
- **SQLite**: Required for database management and operations.

# [Optional] Terms/Concepts Explanation
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows access to the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface used for inputting commands directly to a computer program.<PRD ends>.
As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.
7. Write the markdown file to UML_class.md, adhering to the following format:
   # UML class
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       ......
   ```
8. Treat functions not within a class as global functions, including them in a designated 'Global Functions' section. Detail functions with necessary parameters and data types, including output types if possible.
9. Provide a comprehensive and detailed representation, rather than a brief overview.
10. Seek a balance between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your diagram. Consider encapsulating functions within existing classes to avoid unnecessary complexity."	"# UML class

In this UML class diagram, we have four main classes: `UMM`, `CLI`, `Database`, and `Global_functions`. The `UMM` class is the main entry point of the application. The `CLI` class is responsible for parsing and executing commands from the command-line interface. The `Database` class handles all database-related operations such as creating and connecting to the database, adding, searching, deleting, and updating records, and managing mentorship relations. The `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship` classes represent the entities in the database. The `Global_functions` class contains all the global functions that are not within a class."

  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

In this diagram, we have three main classes: `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship`. Each class represents a table in the database, with fields that correspond to the columns in the table.

The `UMM` class is the main class that interacts with the database and provides the command-line interface for users to interact with the system. It has three fields: `db`, `people`, and `schools`, which are arrays of `Person` and `School` objects, respectively. It also has three methods: `add`, `search`, `delete`, `update`, `mentor`, and `lookup`.

The `add` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and adds it to the corresponding table in the database. The `search` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and returns all the entries in the corresponding table that match the given object. The `delete` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and deletes it from the corresponding table in the database. The `update` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and updates the corresponding entry in the database.

The `mentor` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and assigns a mentor to a student. The `lookup` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and returns the mentor of a given student.

The `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship` classes are related to the `UMM` class through inheritance. The `Person` and `School` classes are subclasses of the `UMM` class, while the `Mentorship` class is a subclass of the `Person` class. This allows us to access the `UMM` class's methods and fields from the `Person` and `School` classes, while also allowing us to access the `Person` class's methods and fields from the `Mentorship` class.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

   UMM.mentor(assign: Mentorship)
   UMM.mentor(lookup: Mentorship)
```
In this diagram, we have three main classes: `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship`. Each class represents a table in the database, with fields that correspond to the columns in the table.

The `UMM` class is the main class that interacts with the database and provides the command-line interface for users to interact with the system. It has three fields: `db`, `people`, and `schools`, which are arrays of `Person` and `School` objects, respectively. It also has three methods: `add`, `search`, `delete`, `update`, `mentor`, and `lookup`.

The `add` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and adds it to the corresponding table in the database. The `search` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and returns all the entries in the corresponding table that match the given object. The `delete` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and deletes it from the corresponding table in the database. The `update` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and updates the corresponding entry in the database.

The `mentor` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and assigns a mentor to a student. The `lookup` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and returns the mentor of a given student.

The `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship` classes are related to the `UMM` class through inheritance. The `Person` and `School` classes are subclasses of the `UMM` class, while the `Mentorship` class is a subclass of the `Person` class. This allows us to access the `UMM` class's methods and fields from the `Person` and `School` classes, while also allowing us to access the `Person` class's methods and fields from the `Mentorship` class.

Overall, this UML class diagram provides a clear and concise representation of the classes and their relationships in the University Management System. It accurately reflects the PRD's requirements and provides a solid foundation for effective coding, testing, and future maintenance."	"# UML class

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

The diagram shows four classes: `IdWorker`, `SidWorker`, `Base62`, and `Main`. The `IdWorker` and `SidWorker` classes represent the two principal components of the project, responsible for generating unique identifiers. The `Base62` class provides Base62 encoding functionality, which is used by both `IdWorker` and `SidWorker`. The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the application and utilizes the other classes to generate and store IDs.

The diagram also includes a `GlobalFunctions` class, which represents the global functions used by the `Main` class to read and write files. These functions are not part of any specific class, but are included in the diagram to provide a complete representation of the design.

The relationships between the classes are as follows:

* `IdWorker` and `SidWorker` use the `Base62` class to encode and decode IDs.
* `Main` uses the `IdWorker` and `SidWorker` classes to generate and store IDs.
* `Main` uses the `GlobalFunctions` class to read and write files.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.
As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

  - `generateId()`: This function generates a unique ID based on the current timestamp and a sequence number. It uses the `nextId()` function to ensure the uniqueness of the ID.
  - `getNextMillis(long)`: This function calculates the next millisecond that can be used to generate an ID. It is used to handle the case where the current timestamp is the same as the last timestamp.
  - `nextId()`: This function generates a unique ID by combining the timestamp, worker ID, and sequence number. It also handles the case where the current timestamp is the same as the last timestamp.

  These functions are used by the `IdWorker` and `SidWorker` classes to generate unique IDs. They extend the `Base62` class to encode the IDs in Base62 format."	"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106"	"deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct"	""	"- Cohesion and Decoupling: The design should aim for high cohesion within individual classes and low coupling between different classes. High cohesion ensures that each class is dedicated to a singular task or concept, enhancing clarity and functionality. Low coupling reduces dependencies among classes, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
- Complexity: Utilize metrics such as the total number of classes, the average number of methods per class, and the depth of the inheritance tree to evaluate complexity. It's important to discern between conceptual classes and attributes; not every noun should become a class. The complexity level should be appropriately balanced, aligning with the specific requirements detailed in the project's Product Requirement Document (PRD).
- Practicability: A practical design should be readable and understandable, offering a clear and comprehensive representation of the software's structures, functionalities, and behaviors. This enhances ease in programming, testing, and maintenance. Modularity should be evident, with each component serving a distinct function, streamlining the development process. Interfaces need to be designed for simplicity, facilitating smooth interactions within the software and with external environments.

  ## Global Functions

  - `generateId()`: This function generates a unique ID based on the current timestamp and a sequence number. It uses the `nextId()` function to ensure the uniqueness of the ID.
  - `getNextMillis(long)`: This function calculates the next millisecond that can be used to generate an ID. It is used to handle the case where the current timestamp is the same as the last timestamp.
  - `nextId()`: This function generates a unique ID by combining the timestamp, worker ID, and sequence number. It also handles the case where the current timestamp is the same as the last timestamp.

  These functions are used by the `IdWorker` and `SidWorker` classes to generate unique IDs. They extend the `Base62` class to encode the IDs in Base62 format."	"# UML class

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

./UMM command target [options..]

## Add records

To add a new student, faculty or school, use the following command:
```
./UMM add person | school [options..]
```

Compulsory options for person:

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Compulsory options for school:

-name: string

## List records

To list all students, faculty or schools, use the following command:
```
./UMM search person | school 
```

Available options for person (at least one option to list records):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Delete records

./UMM delete person | school -id ID

## Update records

./UMM update person | school -id ID [options..]

-id is compulsory to update a person or school record.

Available options for person (at least one option to update a record):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Mentor

To assign a mentor for a student:

./UMM mentor assign -student STUDENT_ID -mentor FACULTY_ID

To look for the mentor of a given student:

./UMM mentor lookup -student STUDENT_ID

To look for students a given mentor mentors:

./UMM mentor lookup -mentor FACULTY_ID

# Acceptance Criteria
Each feature should meet the following criteria:
- **Correctness**: The system should execute commands accurately, reflecting the correct changes in the database.
- **Efficiency**: The system should handle database operations swiftly without delays.
- **Usability**: Users should find the system easy to use, with a straightforward command structure.

# Dependencies
- **C++ Environment**: Necessary for running the main.cpp file.
- **SQLite**: Required for database management and operations.

# [Optional] Terms/Concepts Explanation
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows access to the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface used for inputting commands directly to a computer program.<PRD ends>.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.
As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.
7. Write the markdown file to UML_class.md, adhering to the following format:
   # UML class
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid

8. Treat functions not within a class as global functions, including them in a designated 'Global Functions' section. Detail functions with necessary parameters and data types, including output types if possible.
9. Provide a comprehensive and detailed representation, rather than a brief overview.
10. Seek a balance between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your diagram. Consider encapsulating functions within existing classes to avoid unnecessary complexity."	"# UML class

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

./UMM command target [options..]

## Add records

To add a new student, faculty or school, use the following command:
```
./UMM add person | school [options..]
```

Compulsory options for person:

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Compulsory options for school:

-name: string

## List records

To list all students, faculty or schools, use the following command:
```
./UMM search person | school 
```

Available options for person (at least one option to list records):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

In this UML class diagram, we have three main classes: `UniversityManagementSystem`, `SQLiteDatabase`, and `CommandLineInterface`.

`UniversityManagementSystem` is the main class that represents the University Management System. It has a SQLiteDatabase and a CommandLineInterface as its attributes. It also has methods for adding, searching, deleting, updating, and mentoring records.

`SQLiteDatabase` is a class that represents the SQLite database. It has methods for creating the database, connecting to it, creating tables, adding, searching, deleting, and updating records.

`CommandLineInterface` is a class that represents the command-line interface. It has methods for parsing commands and executing them.

The relationships between the classes are represented by the arrows. The `UniversityManagementSystem` class uses the `SQLiteDatabase` and `CommandLineInterface` classes. This means that the `UniversityManagementSystem` class has a dependency on the `SQLiteDatabase` and `CommandLineInterface` classes."

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

./UMM command target [options..]

## Add records

To add a new student, faculty or school, use the following command:
```
./UMM add person | school [options..]
```

Compulsory options for person:

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Compulsory options for school:

-name: string

## List records

To list all students, faculty or schools, use the following command:
```
./UMM search person | school 
```

Available options for person (at least one option to list records):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Delete records

./UMM delete person | school -id ID

## Update records

./UMM update person | school -id ID [options..]

-id is compulsory to update a person or school record.

Available options for person (at least one option to update a record):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Mentor

To assign a mentor for a student:

./UMM mentor assign -student STUDENT_ID -mentor FACULTY_ID

To look for the mentor of a given student:

./UMM mentor lookup -student STUDENT_ID

To look for students a given mentor mentors:

./UMM mentor lookup -mentor FACULTY_ID

# Acceptance Criteria
Each feature should meet the following criteria:
- **Correctness**: The system should execute commands accurately, reflecting the correct changes in the database.
- **Efficiency**: The system should handle database operations swiftly without delays.
- **Usability**: Users should find the system easy to use, with a straightforward command structure.

# Dependencies
- **C++ Environment**: Necessary for running the main.cpp file.
- **SQLite**: Required for database management and operations.

# [Optional] Terms/Concepts Explanation
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows access to the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface used for inputting commands directly to a computer program.<PRD ends>.
As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.
7. Write the markdown file to UML_class.md, adhering to the following format:
   # UML class
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       ......
   ```
8. Treat functions not within a class as global functions, including them in a designated 'Global Functions' section. Detail functions with necessary parameters and data types, including output types if possible.
9. Provide a comprehensive and detailed representation, rather than a brief overview.
10. Seek a balance between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your diagram. Consider encapsulating functions within existing classes to avoid unnecessary complexity."	"# UML class
